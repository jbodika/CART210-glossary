## Lossy

Lossy is an adjective that is used to describe the loss of data or the dissipation of energy. 
While the first known use of the word had been attributed to the second definition in 1948, in the writing of H.A. Leiter,
the loss of data is more commonly associated with file [compression](../main/glossary.md#compression) in the computation field.[^Merriam-Webster] [^OED]

Although many people associate lossy compression as a digital thing, it also occurs naturally in everyday life. 
Creatures, including humans, are constantly processing a large amount of information from their environment in order to survive. 
However, absorbing all of that data can be overwhelming and not particularly useful, as such, they have evolved to be able to “reduce resource demands by tracking a smaller number of features”.[^Marzen17] 
In other words, they are compressing information in a lossy way, removing redundancies, to be able to quickly react to a stimulus.

File compression itself involves the act of representing data into a series of bits and reconstructing it back to uncompress it. 
Lossy and lossless compression are two types of techniques that can be used to achieve this effect. 
While lossless compression allows us to obtain an identical copy of the original, 
lossy compression returns an approximation of the original data which results in a less accurate but smaller copy. [^Gupta17] 

Lossy Compression is very important in our current society as a large amount of data is constantly being shared all over the world through social media and other platforms. 
As such, we need to be able to reduce the size of this data to be able to quickly transfer information. 
Thus, “lossy techniques are widely used in image and video compression” for their compression and decompression speed 
as well as the fact that it is less important for these visual media to be pixel accurate. [^Gupta17]
