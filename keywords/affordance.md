### Affordance (affordances)

A possibility or set of possibilities for interaction and the effectuation of change given the current state of a system. The visible field of possibility. Some examples include the possible moves a given chess piece can perform given the rules that govern it and the game-state of the board, and the navigation buttons available on a digital interface.

The term also refers to one of Don Norman's principles of design and interaction:

“Affordances: The perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used.”
