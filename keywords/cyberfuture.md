## Cyberfuture

Cyberfuture, as one might find by a quick search, can be defined simply as “a projected future based around cyberspace or computer technology.”[^wiktionary25cyberfuture] It is deceivingly simple, but in truth represents a complicated interlinking definition between how we think of the future and how we interact with different forms of cyberspace.
	To understand cyberfuture, we must define cyberspace. According to Cees J, Hamelink in his chapter in Cyberidentities for the University of Ottawa Press, defines cyberspace as “not limited to the operation of computer networks, but also encompasses all social activities in which digital information and communication technologies (ICT) are deployed.” [^Hamelink98human] These range from a microwave embedded with digital technology to shoes, to any other object embedded with such technologies, therefore contributing to a virtual life-space [^Hamelink98human].
	
If cyberfuture is defined in part by cyberspace, the topic of a cyberfuture would then include discussions on these technologies and how they may affect the ways in which humans develop alongside these digital and mechanical subjects. This as well makes the term anthropocentric, as the effects of technology in the cyberfuture is always discussed around human interactions and societies. 

This idea of “virtual life-space” as discussed by Hamelink seems a popular object of discussion, with instances of cyberfutures being imagined in science-fiction where “there is no physical contact between bodies” [^franck98imagining]. Karen A. Franck discusses an example where “all humans are raised and live alone their entire lives in 10 foot square cells, food and drink and all life support is provided by computer. Contact with anything else is exclusively in a virtual world.”[^franck98imagining]. While Franck’s example is noticeably bleak, the ties of cyberfuture to a social integration, even dependency, on cyberspace is clear. The technologies included in a discussion surrounding cyberfutures do not have to be so overt, but the idea of an essential fusing of  human society and technology is fundamental.

When considering the effects of modern and developing technologies on human society, the discussion is automatically linked to cyberfuture, as any developments of human society involving an integration of technology is such a future.
