## JPEG

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)[^JPEG] is a file format commonly used to compress and store images. It is reffered to as a 
"lossy" format because it compresses and alters the pixel data of the file and is therefore not a "lossless" transfer. It was created in
1992 by the aptly named Joint Photographic Experts Group and they are widely credited with the proliferation of digital imaging with its ease 
of use and storing. 

When pictures are taken using the JPEG compression format, the image data is stored in a RAW[^RAW] file under the .TIFF (Tag Image File Format) file format. When the image is to be stored,
it is then compressed using JPEG and converted to a .JPEG file. When this image is displayed, it is then uncompressed and returned to the RAW format. The method that 
JPEG takes to compression uses the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) method by discarding high-frequency information (such as intensehues and dense packets of data.[^IEEE] 
By discarding this data, it then fills the gap using existing data leading to a lossy compression where high-frequency details are lost and filled in with random data, creating noise or grain. 

Though the data loss through JPEG compression can be severe in some cases, it is mostly considered to be a worthwhile sacrifice for the 
amount of space it saves. Even though more formats have since been released and popularized (such as Apple's HEIC format or the PNG format) 
the JPEG format remains the ol' reliable of image compression. The JPEG's longevity can largely be attributed to the fact that it remains one of the
most efficient and loss-neutral compression formats in modern day. Though some desire truly lossless compression, until this is achieved JPEG will still be used 
by photographers, editors, illustrators and digital creators all around the world, and not many formats have any hope of replacing its reach. 

The identity of the JPEG format as the gold standard for image compression in the modern age solidifies the idea of good image quality as a equal sacrifice of file size
over quality, or noisiness. Similarly to the idea of a "critical mass" point in data storage in the future, the JPEG and other compression methods represent 
the standards that will be adopted in order to expand and store as much data as we can possibly store in the most efficient way. Theories such as Bill Viola's "Data Space"[^DATA]
storage methods show alternate paths we could take to not exactly avoid the possibility of a critical mass poin in data storage, but to restructure data in a way that makes 
the wealth of data we have accessible in ways that don't necessitate more data to be stored. JPEG formats and subsequent innovations in compression represent a predictably human and 
anti-progressive way of dealing with problems, by cramming in more where we shouldn't.
