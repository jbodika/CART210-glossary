## QR Code
 
QR code(quick-response code) is a type of two-dimensional code, first invented by a Japanese company Denso Wave in 1994[^wiki25Denso]. Compared to a regular barcode, a QR code has a faster reading speed and a higher storage capacity. In terms of recognition, a QR code does not require precise alignment with the scanner like a one-dimensional barcode does. It has a maximum error correction capability of 30%, meaning that even if up to 30% of the QR code is damaged, it can still be recognized. Today, QR codes are used in various fields such as payment, identity verification, logistics management, and marketing promotion. 


### History 
1994 : Denso Wave publicly announced QR Codes 

2002: Due to BSE (commonly known as the “mad cow disease”), QR gained attention and was applied in the manufacturing industry and supply chains.

2017: Both Apple's iOS 11 and Android 8.0 have incorporated QR code scanning as a native system feature.

2020: Due to COVID-19, QR codes have been used for payments and accessing menus to reduce physical contact. In some countries, QR codes are also used for COVID-19 contact tracing.

### Uses 
#### Payment 
A QR code can store information such as payment account details, transaction amounts, and order information.When a user or merchant scans the QR code, the payment system quickly reads and decodes the embedded information, then sends the transaction request to the bank or digital wallet for identity verification, deduction, and transfer.In China, 95.7% of Chinese users prefer the QR code payment method.This new payment method has also facilitated the development of local e-commerce in China.[^QRT2025Ricson]

#### Restaurant ordering 
QR Code ordering is a method of placing food orders using QR code technology. Customers scan the QR code on the table, browse the menu, select dishes, and complete the payment directly on their smartphones, without the need for traditional paper menus or waiter intervention. QR Code ordering enhanced guest safety during the pandemic. It not only speeds up the service but also reduces the workload on staff, allowing them to focus on enhancing customer service elsewhere.At the same time, by reducing the use of paper menus, its application also helps protect the environment.[^Ovidius2024Anca]

#### QR code ticket 
QR Code Ticket uses QR code technology to function as an electronic ticket. This type of ticket contains all the necessary attendee information in a scannable format, and is commonly used in various scenarios such as events, travel, and entertainment, including concerts, movies, sports events, and train or flight tickets.

#### Supply chain management 
QR codes can be used in supply chain management to provide digital identification for products, goods, equipment, or documents, making data collection, tracking, management, and sharing more convenient and efficient. In terms of security features, QR codes have characteristics such as data immutability, fair and secure access, total transparency, enhanced traceability, and real-time validation.[^AICCSA2023Munir]
