Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as a field of study is primarily concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. According to John M. Carroll in his influential work "Human Computer Interaction - Brief Intro" (2009), HCI focuses on "understanding how people make use of devices and systems that incorporate or embed computation, and how such devices and systems can be more useful and more usable." Carroll describes HCI as fundamentally multidisciplinary, drawing from computer science, psychology, design, and numerous other fields to understand the relationship between humans and technology.

Harrison, Tatar, and Sengers take on a paradigmatic analysis (human factors, cognitive, or phenomenological), to show the evolution by which HCI as a field of study seeks to improve the relationship between humans and computational technologies through better understanding of user needs, capabilities, contexts, and experiences.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has a significant relationship with New Media, as both fields examine the evolving interfaces between humans and technology, but from different perspectives.
According to Lev Manovich in "The Language of New Media" (2001), New Media studies focuses on the cultural and aesthetic dimensions of digital technologies, while HCI provides the underlying principles for how these technologies are designed for human use. Manovich argues that "the interface shapes how the user conceives of the computer itself" and "determines how users think of any media object accessed via a computer." This perspective highlights how HCI design principles directly influence the cultural experience of New Media.

The relationship between these fields is symbiotic: HCI provides frameworks for creating usable interfaces, while New Media studies examines the cultural, social, and artistic implications of these interfaces. As technologies evolve, both fields continue to inform each other - HCI practitioners increasingly incorporate cultural considerations from New Media studies, while New Media theorists analyze how interface design shapes digital culture and user experience.
This complementary relationship extends Harrison, Tatar, and Sengers' paradigmatic analysis by suggesting that the third paradigm of HCI (phenomenologically situated) particularly aligns with New Media's concern for cultural context and meaning-making in technological interactions.

The following diagram illustrates the three paradigms of Human-Computer Interaction as described by Harrison, Tatar, and Sengers in their influential paper:

1. **First Paradigm: Human Factors**
    - Focuses on engineering and ergonomics
    - Views the human as another component in the system
    - Aims to optimize the fit between humans and machines
    - Uses formal metrics and controlled lab studies
2. **Second Paradigm: Classical Cognitivism/Information Processing**
    - Treats the mind as an information processor (the mind-as-computer metaphor)
    - Focuses on modeling and improving communication between human and computer
    - Uses predictive models and controlled experiments
    - Values rationality and task completion
3. **Third Paradigm: Phenomenologically Situated**
    - Focuses on meaning and context (social, cultural, historical)
    - Views interaction as a situated phenomenon
    - Uses ethnographic and participatory design methods
    - Values embodiment, social context, and meaning-making
