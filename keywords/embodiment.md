## Embodiment

Embodiment is a term which is informed by and used in many different fields. 
Consequently, embodiment is a highly polysemic term, even inside a given discipline. 

Many researchers believe embodiment to be crucial to intelligence, artificial or natural.[^txtZ] This sort of cognition, embodied cognition, leads us to wonder what sorts of bodies true artificial intelligences might require in the future. Many different embodied forms of intelligences can inform that discussion. For example, physical bodies equipped with sensorimotor skills modeled after living organisms or even living organisms themselves and their autonomous/autopoietic character can be seen as two different embodiments of intelligence[^txtZ]. 

Some physiological illusions provide insight into how embodiment functions. One such illusion,  the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI), occurs during an experiment in which a participant observes a synthetic hand being stroked at the same time as their own hand[^txtRE]. Eventually, the participant starts feeling the strokes on the synthetic hand even if their real hand hasn't been touched[^txtRE]. Given proper visual information (the synchronous stroking), they assimilate the hand as their own.  In other words, it is possible for an external object, which bears morphological resemblance to a human body part, to be incorporated as a part of a person's body. 

In the context of new media artforms - such as Virtual Reality (VR) - in which virtual representations of bodies are prominent, embodiment represents a key concern.

In the case of VR, the challenge rests in trying to understand if and how it is possible for a person to feel the same things towards a virtual body in a virtual world as towards their biological body situated in a physical world. [^txtVR] Three conditions can break down that challenge and contribute to creating a sense of embodiment (SoE) in VR contexts.

First, a person must feel a sense of self-location. In other words, they must locate their self as being contained in the body space represented by the virtual body. First person perspective can enhance this feeling, since it emulates our real-world egocentric perspective[^txtVR].

Second, a sense of agency over the virtual body needs to be felt by the person "inhabiting" it. This sense can be described as a feeling of motor control over the body paired with the impression that the predicted consequences of an action match its actual consequences (in other words, feeling like you actually performed that action, not a random event). Thus, decreasing the latency between actual movement in the physical world and visual feedback in the virtual world is essential. Having a strong delay between the two can negatively impact the feeling of agency and, by extension, embodiment[^txtVR]. 

Third, a sense of ownership should be felt by the person immersed inside the virtual world. A virtual avatar's morphological similarity to human body can increase this feeling of ownership[^txtVR].
