## GUI

GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a way for users to interact and communicate with computers. Unlike the Command Line Interface (CLI), the GUI does not display code details. Instead, it facilitates human-computer interaction through graphical elements like windows, icons, and buttons.[^Shardeum23What]

Vannevar Bush's 1945 paper, "As We May Think," seems to have had a significant influence on the prototype of the GUI. The paper introduced the concept of an electronic device called Memex, which integrated various functionalities to aid human thought processes.[^Vannevar45As]

Today, GUI has evolved to offer a wide range of functionalities to meet users' operational needs across various devices and applications. All operating systems, software applications, and websites now incorporate GUI elements to enhance user experience.[^priya24Evolution]
